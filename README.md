# FLOSS Weekly Archival Project

The goal of this site is to capture data for all of TWiT.tv's 
[FLOSS Weekly episodes](https://twit.tv/shows/floss-weekly). These episodes are an invalueable resource, where creators 
and maintainers of *hundureds* of open source projects have been interviewed.

This site is being created because the list of episodes with all their guests, long something captured for all in 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FLOSS_Weekly_episodes) may be removed shortly and that list, notable
or not, is of great *importance* to be preserved.

Shortly a markdown page will be created here reproducing the tables of the episode lists. 

Longer-term, the goal is to create a data-driven static site where each episode can be filled out with more data and 
links to the projects that are fetured in that episode.
